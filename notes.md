# Ask For Clarification
Bar Chart axes - What is it?

"X-axis should show labels for each data value

Think about how you would need to structure your data to associate a label to each value
Y-axis should show ticks at certain values

Think about where you would configure these values. Should they be part of the data or the options to the bar chart function."

# To Do After

Multiple Value (Stacked) bar charts
Allow the user to pass multiple values for each bar.

Think about how you would need to structure this data compared to a single bar chart.
This should also support all the features of the single bar chart, including

Customizable bar colours, per value
Customizable label colours
